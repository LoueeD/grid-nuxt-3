# Grid Views

Gridfox Grid Views allow you to see a list of items within a table. These grids of data can then be sorted, searched and filtered.

Grid Views are created and configured by your Project Admins.

Using a Grid View, you can add new rows, edit or remove existing rows of data where each Row is an individual Record.

## Adding a New Row

New Records can be created from Grid Views

1. Click **Add Row** in the top right hand corner

   Alternatively, you can click **Add New Row** at the bottom of the table
2. Complete the information required for the new Record
3. Click **Save**

This creates a new Record. This Record will show up on any other [Views](/gridfox-project/an-introduction-to-views) for this Table.

You can also create new Records for Tables from [Board Views,](/gridfox-project/boards) [Calendar Views](/gridfox-project/calendars) and [Gantt Views](/gridfox-project/gantt-screens).

2. Click into cells in the Grid View and edit the Records
3. Click **Save all changes** in the top right hand corner

You can then choose to disable Inline Edit mode by using the toggle.
