# Gantt Views

Gantt Views in Gridfox enable you to visualise the schedule of your Records over time. You can see at a glance where activities and tasks may overlap and how long they will take.

Gantt Views are created and configured by your Project Admins.

You can scroll horizontally along a Gantt View to see the data in earlier or future months. By default, the current day will always show in the centre. To view more detail about an entry on the Gantt View, you can click on it to open up the Record.

## Adding a New Event

New Records can be created from Gantt Views.

1. Click **Add Row** in the top right hand corner
2. Complete the information required for the new Record
3. Click **Save**

This creates a new Record. This Record will show up on any other [Views](/gridfox-project/an-introduction-to-views) for the Table.
