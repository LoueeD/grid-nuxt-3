# An Introduction to Forms

Gridfox Forms allow you to collect information from anyone, creating new Records in your [Tables](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-tables) with each Form submission.

Forms work across all devices and can be embedded on your existing websites, and can be customised to match your company branding.

Forms can be used for many different purposes, for example:

* **Enquiry Forms**

  Feed new leads directly into your Gridfox CRM by embedding a Gridfox enquiry Form on your site
* **Staff Feedback**

  Capture feedback and ideas from your team by sending out a Gridfox Form
* **Event Attendance**

  Know who is going to attend your next event by asking attendees to complete a Gridfox Form
