# Dashboard Views

Gridfox Dashboards let you see a snapshot of data from your Gridfox Project. See a summary of information from your Records, shown as multiple Charts on the Dashboard.

Dashboards are created and configured by your Project Admins.

You cannot create or edit data from a Dashboard. Other [Views](/gridfox-project/an-introduction-to-views) can be used to do this.
