# Board Views

Gridfox Board Views enable you to visualise your Records in a board of cards, divided into columns. This is also known as a Kanban Board.

Board Views are created and configured by your Project Admins.

When viewing a Board you can drag each of the cards between the columns to update them. To view more detail about a card you can click on it to open up the Record.

## Adding a Board Card

New Records can be created from Board Views.

1. Click **Add New Card** in the column that you would like to add the Card to

   Alternatively, you can open the column menu and click **Add New Card**
2. Complete the information required for the new Record
3. Click **Save**

This creates a new Record. This Record will show up on any other [Views](/gridfox-project/an-introduction-to-views) for this Table.

{% include tip.html content="If you don't have permission to create new Records for a particular Board, the button will be unavailable. Your permission to access it is controlled by your Project Admins." %}

## Moving Board Cards

To change which column or row a Card is in, drag it to the place that you would like to move it to. This will immediately update the Record with the new information.

## Customising Board Columns

To make sure you can see exactly the information you need on screen, you can collapse and expand columns on Board Views.

Open the menu for a column and click **Collapse Column**. To show the column again, open the menu and click **Expand Column**.
