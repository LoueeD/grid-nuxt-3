# Managing your Account

When you sign up for Gridfox, or when youâ€™re invited to join a Project, you will have a Gridfox Account created. 

You can make changes within your Account, such as amending your personal information or setting up multifactor authentication.

Within your Gridfox Account, you will have the ability to create your own Projects. To learn more about creating Projects, head over to our separate help section: [Building a Gridfox Project](/building-a-project/how-to-use-gridfox).

## Updating your Personal Details

To update your personal details, such as Name and Company, navigate to the Account Management section by clicking the **Account Menu** in the top right hand corner.

Here your profile information will be shown.

You can make any changes you need and then click the **Save** button.
