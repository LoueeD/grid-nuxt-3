# An Introduction to Views

Within a Gridfox Project, you will have access to several different Views. From a View, you can see Record information and make changes to data in the Project.

All the Views that you have access to are listed in the left hand navigation panel.

Views are configured and customized by your Project Admins.

There are several different types of Views in Gridfox, each with their own features and functionality.

## Grid Views

Use [Grid Views](/gridfox-project/grid-views) to see a list of data, similar to the layout of a spreadsheet.
