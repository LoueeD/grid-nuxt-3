# Deleting Tables

If you have decided that you no longer need one of your existing Tables, it can be deleted. Deleting a Table will remove:

* All Records for the Table
* Any Dashboard [Charts](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-dashboards) which use the Table
* Any [Views](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-views) which use the Table, including Calendars, Boards and Gantt Screens
* Any [Workflows](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-workflows) for the Table
* Any [Forms](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-forms) for the Table

Tables can be deleted using either from the View menu, the View Editor or the Explorer. All methods are described below.
