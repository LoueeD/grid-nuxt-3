# Updating Tables

The [Tables](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-tables) in your Gridfox Projects can be changed and updated at any time. The Table itself can be directly amended by being renamed.

See the help pages for [Fields](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-fields) and [Views](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-views) [](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-screens)if you want to change the Field information or layout of Views.

## Renaming a Table

Changing a Table Name will update the Grid View name in the navigation bar for everyone who uses the Project.

You can use either the View Editor or the Explorer to amend the names of Tables. Both methods are described below.

Remember that Tables have both a singular and a plural name. When you are making changes to Table names, check that both have updated as you expect.

### Renaming a Table using the View Editor

{% include tip.html content="The View Editor allows you to make quick changes to your Project configuration and your View layouts." %}

1. Navigate to the [Grid View](/building-a-project/grid-views) for the Table that you would like to rename
2. Open the **Create** menu in the bottom left hand corner
3. Click **Edit Current View**
4. In the Table Name section, change the name of the Table
5. Click **Save** in the bottom right hand corner

The singular and plural name will update accordingly.
