# Custom Screens

Custom screens are bespoke user-interfaces for specific use-cases that are created for you by our Gridfox team. 

For example, CSG, The Global Talent Experts, leveraged a Custom Screen to manage timesheet bookings. 

Custom Screens are available on our Custom plan and will be managed by your Project Admins.
