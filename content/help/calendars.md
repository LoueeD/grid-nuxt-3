# Calendar Views

If you have Records that contain date information, Gridfox enables you to visualise your Records using Calendar Views.

Calendar Views are created and configured by your Project Admins.

There are two types of Calendar Views within Gridfox:

1. **Grid Calendars** - Records are shown in a monthly view. 

   ![Grid Calendar](/assets/images/grid-calendar-view.png "Grid Calendar")
2. **Column Calendars** - Records are shown in columns grouped by day, week or month

## Adding a Calendar Event

New Records can be created from Calendar Views.

1. Click **Add Event** in the top right hand corner
2. Complete the information required for the new Record
3. Click **Save**

This creates a new Record. This Record will show up on any other [Views](/gridfox-project/an-introduction-to-views) for the Table.
