# List Fields

List Fields can be used where you want your Users to select a value from a fixed list of options.

For example, if you were using Gridfox as a Task Tracker, you may choose to add a List Field to your Tasks Table called Status and add List Values of 'To Do', 'In Progress' and 'Done'. You can then track where each of your Tasks are up to.

You can specify that a List Field is required to be completed for Records, but you cannot set it as the Reference Field for a Table.

## Configuring List Field Values

You can specify the values for a List Field using either the Grid View Editor or the Explorer.

Click on the Field in either the Explorer or the Grid View Editor to open the left hand configuration menu.

Click **Add List Item** and give it a label. Repeat this step until you have added all of the List item Values you require.

## Specifying Default List Values

When you are configuring the List Field Values, you can optionally choose for one of the values to be the default value.

This means that every time a new Record is created, this value will be selected by default. The User creating the Record can select a different value if required.

## Color Coding List Items

To help give your Users an at-a-glance view of data, you can color code the List Item Values. 

This color coding can then be shown on [Calendar Screens](/building-a-project/calendar-screens), [Boards](/building-a-project/board-screens), [Gantt Charts](/building-a-project/gantt-screens) and Dashboard [Charts](/building-a-project/chart-types).

When configuring the List Field Values, using either Grid View Editor or the Explorer, click the grey box in the Color column to set a color for the List Field Value.
