## Enabling & Disabling Documents

{% include note.html content="Documents have been replaced by [File Fields](/building-a-project/file-fields). Please use this feature instead." %}

You can optionally allow your Users to attach Documents to Records.

You can choose for each Table whether Documents can be uploaded against Records. By default, Documents are disabled on all Tables.

The setting can be changed at any time using either the View Editor or the Table Explorer.

### Enabling & Disabling Documents in the Grid View Editor

Start by selecting the Grid View for the Table. Open the View Editor by clicking **Edit Current View** in the bottom left **Create** menu or by clicking **Edit** in the menu for the View.

Open the left hand settings panel by clicking on one of the Fields in the Grid.

Toggle the **Documents Allowed** checkbox in the right hand **Table Settings** panel. Save the model to confirm your changes.
