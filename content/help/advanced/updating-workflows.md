You can make changes to your Workflows at any time.

To update a Workflow, select the **Automate** tab in the top right hand corner of a Project.

Select the Workflow that you would like to make changes to from the list of Project Workflows in the left hand navigation bar.

Make any changes that are required, such as renaming the Workflow or changing the Workflow Steps.

You can also choose whether the Workflow should be enabled or disabled using the **Workflow Status** toggle.

Once you are happy with your changes, click **Save** in the top right corner of the canvas.
