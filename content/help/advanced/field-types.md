# Field Types

When [creating a new Field](/building-a-project/creating-fields) for a Table, you must choose a Field Type from one of the options in the grid below. The Field Type determines what sort of information can be stored in the Field.

Each Field Type has different options available, such as whether it can be set as a [Reference Field](/building-a-project/reference-fields), as a [Required Field](/building-a-project/field-settings#required-fields), or that they must contain [unique values](/building-a-project/field-settings#unique-fields). Some Fields have additional settings available, such as the ability to set default values.
