When you sign up to Gridfox, you will be given an Account. Within your Account you can create your Projects, configure them as you need, and then invite Users to those Projects. 

## Getting Started with Gridfox

There are a few steps to get you up and running with your custom applications in Gridfox

1. **Projects**

   Firstly, [create your Projects](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-projects). You can start from scratch or use our [Templates](/templates/) to get going.
2. **Tables**

   [Create your Tables](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-tables) within the Projects. Tables are how you define the data that you would like to store. [Fields](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-fields) are then added to Tables to define the pieces of information you would like to store about your Table Records.

   You can think of Tables like worksheets on a spreadsheet and Fields are the columns in the spreadsheet worksheet.

   The users of your application can then add and edit Records in the Tables, where Records are similar to rows in the spreadsheet worksheet.
3. **Views**

   Customize and setup new [Views](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-views)[](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-screens) for the Tables. You can create Boards, Calendars, Gantt Charts and Dashboards on top of the Tables.
4. **Workflows**

   Setup any [workflows](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-workflows) to automate your business processes.
5. **Permissions**

   Configure the [permissions](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-permissions) that your users will have once they are invited to your Project.
6. **User**

   Lastly, [invite your users](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-users) to your Project for them to start creating Records and working together.
