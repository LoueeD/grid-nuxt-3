# An Introduction to Dashboards

In your Gridfox Project you can create Dashboard Views to help your Users visualise and understand the Project data across multiple Tables. Dashboards are made up of different chart components such as pie charts and bar charts. If a User doesn't have permissions to see a data in one of the Dashboard Charts then the Chart will be hidden from them.

Dashboards that you [create](/building-a-project/creating-dashboards) will appear in the left hand navigation sidebar for your Users to see, along with all other [Views](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-views).
