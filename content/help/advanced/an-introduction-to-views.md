# An Introduction to Views

Gridfox Views allow your users to interact with the [Tables](https://staging--gridfox.netlify.app/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-tables) that you have created. Once you have created your Tables and [added Fields](https://staging--gridfox.netlify.app/building-a-project/creating-fields) to them, you can then configure each of the Views you require.

There are several different types of View:

1. **[Grid Views](/building-a-project/grid-views)**

   Every Table will have a Grid View automatically created. The layout of this can be configured.

2. **[Board Views](/building-a-project/board-views)**

   You can add a Board View to a Table. This will display the Records as cards which are grouped into columns and optionally rows also. This View is useful where your Records may go through a set of stages, for instance a To Do List where the Records could be grouped by whether they are To Do, In Progress or Done.

3. **[Calendar Views](/building-a-project/calendar-views)**

   Calendar Views can be added over the top of a Table. This will allow your users to see the Records on a calendar, where the layout of each of the calendars can be configured.

4. **[Gantt Views](/building-a-project/gantt-views)**

   Gantt Views can be added over the top of a Table. This will allow your users to visualize the timeline of Records and where events may overlap.

5. **[Custom Views](/building-a-project/custom-screens)**

   If you would like a tailored View in your Project, [get in touch](https://staging--gridfox.netlify.app/custom/contact/) with our team.

Views can be created and configured at any point in time.

You can [hide and show](/building-a-project/hiding-and-showing-views) Views in the navigation menu and [create filters](/building-a-project/saved-filters) for each of them.

To make changes to a View, you can click **Edit Current View** in the bottom left menu. Alternatively, use the View Menu to edit, hide or delete a View.
