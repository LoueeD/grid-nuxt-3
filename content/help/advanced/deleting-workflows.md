# Deleting Workflows

If you have decided that one of your Workflows is no longer required, then it can be deleted. If you would like the Workflow not to run temporarily, you could disable it instead of deleting it.

{% include note.html content="Deleting a workflow cannot be undone." %}

1. Select the **Automate** tab in the top right hand corner of your Project
2. Select the Workflow that you want to delete from the list of Workflows in the left hand menu
3. Click **Delete**
4. Confirm the action by clicking **Delete** again

Your Workflow will now be deleted. Changes take effect immediately.
