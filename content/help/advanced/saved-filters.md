# Saved Filters

For your [Views](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-views), you can create Saved Filters. These will show a subset of the Records based on the filter conditions that you apply. Saved Filters show up in the left hand navigation bar for your Users. They are a quick way to get access to the data you regularly need. For example, you could create a Saved Filter for all the Tasks due this week to make sure people can prioritise their work accordingly.

The Saved Filters that you create can be utilised on your [Dashboard Charts](/building-a-project/chart-types) and in [Workflows](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-workflows).
