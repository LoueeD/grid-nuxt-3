# An Introduction to Tables

In Gridfox, Tables are used to define the data that you would like to store in your Projects. For example,

* In a CRM Project, you may have a Table for Companies and another for Opportunities
* In a Marketing Campaign Planner Project, you may have a Table for Campaigns and another for Activities
* In a Project Tracker Project, you may have a Table for Projects and another for Tasks

Fields are then added to Tables to describe what you would like to store about Records in the Table. For example,

* On a Tasks Table, you may have Fields for Task Description, Task Owner and Due Date
* On an Events Table, you may have Fields for Start Date, End Date and Event Name
* On a Customers Table, you may have Fields for Customer Name, Sector and Number of Employees

You can think of Tables like worksheets on a spreadsheet, where Fields are the columns in the spreadsheet worksheet.

![Field](/assets/images/field-highlighted.jpg "Field")

Once you have [created your Tables](/building-a-project/creating-tables) and [Fields](/building-a-project/creating-fields), the Users of your Project can then add and edit Records in the Tables, where Records are similar to rows in the spreadsheet worksheet.

Your Tables can then be [linked together](/building-a-project/linking-tables) to allow your Users to create relationships between different Records.

## Setting Up Tables

To set up Tables for your Project you will need to:

1. [Create the Tables](/building-a-project/creating-tables)
2. Add [Fields](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-fields) to the Tables
3. [Link](/building-a-project/linking-tables) Tables together
4. Design [Views](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-views)[](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-screens) for each Table

You can then continue with the remainder of your Project setup: creating any [Workflows](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-workflows), configuring [Permissions](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-permissions) and then inviting [Users](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-users).
