# Creating Projects

When creating a [Project](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-projects) in Gridfox you can choose to create a new Project from scratch, or use one of the available [templates](/templates/). All Projects are created from the homepage, which can be accessed by navigating to [app.gridfox.com](http://app.gridfox.com/) or by clicking the **Back to Projects** link when in a Project.

{% include tip.html content="If you are an [Account Admin](/building-a-project/adding-account-administrators) for more than one Account, you will have the ability to create a Project for each of those Accounts. Ensure you select to create the Project in the correct Account." %}

## Creating an Empty Project

You can create an empty Project which you can customise and configure from scratch.

1. From your homepage, click **New Project**
2. Enter a name for the Project
3. Click the next arrow

Your Project will be created, and you will be taken to the View Editor for your first [Table](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-tables). You can name the Table and start [adding Fields](/building-a-project/creating-fields).

{% include tip.html content="If you prefer to use the Explorer to create your Tables and Fields, simply select the **Explorer** tab in the top right hand corner." %}

## Creating a Project from a Template

Rather than starting from scratch, you can create a Project using one of the Gridfox [templates](/templates).

1. From your homepage, click **Explore Templates**
2. Find the template you need in the template library
3. Click **Start with this template**
4. Enter a name for the Project
5. Click the next arrow

A copy of the template will be created in your account. You can then customise and configure the template right away by changing [Fields](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-fields), amending [Views](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-views) or adding [Workflows](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-workflows).

If you want to remove all the data in the template, you can [delete all the Records](/gridfox-project/deleting-records#deleting-many-records) at the same time.

## Creating a Project from your existing Data

If you have an existing spreadsheet or system that you would like to replace with a Gridfox Project, use the **Import My Data** button to get started. Our team will help you get up and running from your existing spreadsheet or system.

1. Within a Project, click **Upload Logo** in the top left hand corner
2. Choose your image
3. Adjust the size and placement of the image
4. Click **Save**

This logo will be shown to all Users in your Project.
