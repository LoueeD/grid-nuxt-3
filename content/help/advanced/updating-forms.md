# Updating Forms

You can make changes to the setup and configuration of your Forms at any time.

1. Select the **Forms** tab in the top right hand corner
2. Select the Form that you want to make changes to from the list
3. Make the required changes, such as renaming the Form or changing the Form Fields

   See the help page on [Creating Forms](/building-a-project/creating-forms) for more details on how to change Form configuration
4. Click **Save & Share**

The Form will immediately be updated.

{% include note.html content="The Form link will remain fixed, even if you change the Form configuration. If you make changes to a Form that has been shared, remember that these changes will show as soon as you save the changes to the Form." %}
