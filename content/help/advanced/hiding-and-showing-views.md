# Hiding and Showing Views

You can choose which Views should be shown in the navigation bar for your Users. For example, if you have created a [Board](/building-a-project/board-views) for a Table, you may wish to hide the standard Grid View for that Table. Or there may be Tables which don't need to be directly accessed such as a Notes Table where you capture Notes about Tasks. 

To restrict a User’s ability to see a Table entirely, make sure to restrict their [Permissions](https://staging--gridfox.netlify.app/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-permissions) so they cannot see the data.

## Hiding a View
