# Calendar Views

Calendar Views allow you to see your Records plotted on a variety of calendar layouts. This could be useful for:

* **Meeting Schedule**

  See your upcoming scheduled client meetings
* **Project Timelines**

  Plot all your projects on one calendar view to see when teams might require some extra support or time
* **Employee Holidays & Sickness**

  Show a calendar of employee absences divided up by team or group

Gridfox offers two types of Calendar View: the Column and the Grid.

The Grid Calendar shows a month of data at one time.

The Column Calendar can be used to show a week, several weeks or several months of data depending on the settings chosen. You can also optionally divide the columns into rows to group the Records.

## Creating Calendar Views

1. Open the **Create** menu in the bottom left hand corner
2. Click **Calendar**
3. Enter a name for your calendar
4. Click the next arrow

{% include tip.html content="You can use `Ctrl` + `\` to open the **Create** menu if it is currently collapsed." %}

The Calendar settings will then be shown in the centre of your screen.

### Configuring a Grid Calendar

With the Calendar settings panel now displayed on your screen, Users can begin following the step-by-step process to configure the data that they want to show in their calendar. Below are the required steps that every User will go through when setting up their Calendar:  

1. Choose which **Table** you want to show Records from
2. Choose which Field you would like for your **Start Date** of each calendar event
3. Choose which Field you would like for your **End Date** of each calendar event
4. Choose which Field you would like for your **Title**

{% include note.html content="you cannot use Icon and Image Fields when setting the Title of your Calendar" %}

Proceeding through these required steps will set your Calendar to a Grid View, as is the preset for Calendar Views. If you wish to configure your Calendar in a Column View, please proceed with the Optional Steps. 

### Configuring a Column Calendar

To view your Calendar in a Column format, proceed with the optional Column Settings steps in the Calendar settings panel 

* **Column Settings**

  Choose whether each column should show a day, a week or a month of data.

### Optional Settings

There are a series of optional settings that are available when configuring your Calendar View. 

* **Description Field**\
  \
  Choose the description field that you want to show on event blocks
* **Row Settings**

  Optionally group the Records into rows based on a List Field, a User Field, a User Group Field or Time.

  Choosing one of these, except the Time option, will show an additional setting for you to pick which Field should be used.
* **Total Field**

  Optionally show the total value in a chosen Field for each of the columns. This can be a Money or Number Field.
* **Colour Settings**\
  \
  You can optionally colour code each Event on the Calendar based on the value in a List, User or Group Field. Select this in the **Colour Settings** section.

Once you have finished all the configuration, click **Save** to create your new Calendar View.

## Updating Calendar Views

Calendar Views can be amended at any time.

Click **Edit Current View** when you are looking at the Calendar. Alternatively, open the View menu and click **Edit**.

Make any changes that are needed and then click the **Save** button. Changes will take effect immediately for everyone in the Project.
