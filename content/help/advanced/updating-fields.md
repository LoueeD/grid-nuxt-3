# Updating Fields

Once you have created and saved a new Field on your Table, there are some restrictions on the changes that you can make to that Field. 

You can rename an existing Field at any time. This will not affect the data in the Field. You can choose to edit the Field using either the Explorer or the Grid View Editor.

You cannot change the [Field Type](/building-a-project/field-types) of an existing Field on a Table. If you need to do this, delete your existing Field and create a new one.

{% include tip.html content="If there is data in a field that you are deleting, use the export and import data process to move the data from the existing field to a new one before you delete the existing field. For more information, seeÂ [exporting and importing data](/gridfox-project/import-export)." %}
