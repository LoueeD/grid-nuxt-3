# Board Views

Board Views allow you to get an at-a-glance look at your Records, by grouping them into columns and rows. Board Views may be useful for:

* **To Do List**

  Group your tasks into columns to track what is To Do, In Progress and Done
* **Opportunity Tracking**

  Show the progress of each of your sales opportunities, grouping by their status and sales region
* **Roadmap Planning**

  Group features to develop by delivery phase and delivery team

For more ideas and examples, see our [Board Tutorials](/tutorials/tags/boards).

{% include tip.html content="You can create as many Boards as you like in your Projects. You can also create multiple Boards for the same Table to allow you to get different views of the same data." %}

## Creating Board Views

1. Open the **Create** menu in the bottom left hand corner
2. Click **Board**
3. Enter a name for the Board View
4. Click the next arrow

{% include tip.html content="You can use `Ctrl` + `\` to open the **Create** menu if it is currently collapsed." %}

![Create Board](/assets/images/createnewboard.gif "Create Board")

You will now be guided through the steps to configure your new Board.

1. Choose the Table that your Board should show Records from, then click **Next**
2. Choose which columns your Records should be grouped into

   The Records in the Table can be grouped by a Field of one of the following [Types](/building-a-project/field-types): List, User, User Group or linked Parent

   Select the appropriate Field from the list and click **Next**.

   Alternatively, you can create a new List Field to group by by selecting the **Create New** option
3. Choose the information that should show about each Record by specifying the Fields that should be shown on a Board card

   Drag the fields from the Available Fields column into the Card Fields column, then click **Next**
4. Click **Save**

## Additional Board Settings

To customise your Board further, take a look at the additional settings available in the Optional Steps section of the Board configuration.

### Card Icon

You can choose an icon to show on each of the Board cards. This can be an Icon Field from the Table, or alternatively you can show the initials of any User Field from the Table.

### Show Field Names

You can choose to show or hide Field Names that feature in your Cards. To configure this setting, simply click the drop down menu and select either Show or Hide. 

{% include note.html content="Field Names are configured to not show by default so you will need to configure this optional setting if you wish to show them." %}

### Column Total

It may be useful to see the total value of Records in a column. For example, if you have a Board of sales opportunities, you can show the total value of opportunities in each of the stages.

Select a number or money field in the **Column Total** section.

{% include note.html content="If you have also divided your Board into rows, a total will be shown for each column and row combination." %}

### Card Colours

The Board cards can be colour coded to help your users understand the data at a glance.

Select a List, User or Group Field to control the colour which is applied to each card.

### Row Settings

A Board can be divided into rows as well as columns. You can specify which Field to group the Records by in the Row Settings section.

The Records can be grouped by a List Field, a User Field, a Group Field, or by Parent.

## Updating a Board when using a Board

If you need to make quick changes to a Board whilst you are [using it](/building-a-project/board-screens), provided the Board has been grouped by a List Field, you can:

* Rename an existing list item by clicking into the column title
* Add a new list item using the **Add New Column** button
* Remove an existing list item by using the **Delete Column** item in the column settings menu

Also, if the Board has been colour coded by the List Item, you can choose a new colour for a list item using the colour square in the column header.
