# Creating Fields

[Fields](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-fields) are used to define specific pieces of information that you would like to capture about Records in your Gridfox Tables. You can add new Fields to [Tables](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-tables) at any time.

Fields can be created using either the View Editor or the Explorer. Both methods are described below.

Once a Field has been added to a Table, data can be added in this new Field for each of the Records in the Table.

## Creating Fields using the Grid View Editor

1. Select the [Grid View](/building-a-project/grid-views) for the Table that you want to add Fields to
2. Open the **Create** menu in the bottom left hand corner
3. Click **Edit Current View**
4. Click the plus icon in the Grid to add a new Field, choosing a [Field Type](/building-a-project/field-types) and entering the Field Name

## Creating Fields using the Explorer
