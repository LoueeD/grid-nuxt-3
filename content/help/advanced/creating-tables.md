# Creating Tables

[Tables](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-tables) are used to define the data that you would like to store in your Projects. Tables are made up of [Fields](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-fields) and Records.

New Tables can be created at any time. Once a Table has been created, you can then add new [Fields](/building-a-project/creating-fields) to it, where Fields define what information you want to store about Records in the Tables. You can also build [Views](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-views) for the Table.

Users in the Project can then add Records to these Tables. Once you have created a Table it can be [amended](/building-a-project/updating-tables) by renaming it, or [adding](/building-a-project/creating-fields) and [changing](/building-a-project/updating-fields) the Fields on the Table.

Tables can be created in Gridfox using either the View Editor or the Explorer. Both methods are described below.

## Creating a Table using the View Editor

{% include tip.html content="The View Editor allows you to make quick changes to your Project configuration and your View layouts." %} 

1. Open the **Create** menu in the bottom left hand corner of your screen
2. Select **Table (Grid)**
3. Enter a name for the Table and click the next arrow

   The singular and plural names for the Table will auto-populate based on what you enter at this step
4. [Add Fields](/building-a-project/creating-fields) to your new Table
5. Click **Save** in the bottom right hand corner

If you haven't specified one of the Fields in the Table to be the [Reference Field](/building-a-project/reference-fields) then saving the new Table will prompt you to do this.
