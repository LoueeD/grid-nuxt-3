# Updating Records

To update or edit a Record, start by selecting a Record from any of the [Views](/gridfox-project/an-introduction-to-views).

Make any changes that you need and then click **Save** or **Save & Close**.

{% include note.html content="If you donâ€™t have permission to edit or delete certain Records then the **Save**, **Save & Close** and **Delete** buttons will be greyed out and unavailable." %}

Should you need to batch edit a larger quantity of Records, you can also export your table of Records into a spreadsheet. You can find out more about how to do this in our [Export and Import](/gridfox-project/import-export) section.

## Updating Linked Records

When you are viewing a Record with associated [linked Records](/gridfox-project/linked-records), you can choose to add new linked Records or to unlink existing Records.

See the creating Records help to learn how to [create new linked Records](/gridfox-project/creating-records#creating-linked-records).

If you wish to unlink a related Record, when viewing a Record click the checkbox next to one of the related Records and then click **Unlink**.
