# Updating Projects

As your business grows and changes over time, your Gridfox Projects can grow and change with you. You can amend the setup of your Project at any time.

To change your [Tables](/building-a-project/updating-tables), [Fields](/building-a-project/updating-fields), [](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-screens)[Views](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-views), [Workflows](/building-a-project/updating-workflows) or User [permissions](/building-a-project/configuring-group-permissions), see the help sections for these features.

For the Project itself, it can be renamed and have a new logo applied.

## Renaming a Project

To rename a Gridfox Project, navigate to the homepage by clicking the Gridfox icon in the top left of the screen or by using the **Back to Projects** link.

Open the Project menu and click **Rename Project**.

Amend the name then click out of the text box to confirm the change. This will update the name of the Project immediately for all Users in your Project.
