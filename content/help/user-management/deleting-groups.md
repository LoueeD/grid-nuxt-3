# Deleting Groups

If one of the Groups in your Project is no longer required, then it can be removed.

Removing a Group will also remove all Users in this Group from the Project. Make sure to [change the Group](/building-a-project/updating-users) of any Users that should still be in the Project.

1. Select the **User** tab in the top right hand corner
2. Click the menu arrow next to the name of the Group that you would like to delete
3. Click **Delete Group**
4. Click **Delete** to confirm the action.

The Group will be deleted and any Users in the Group will be removed from the Project.
