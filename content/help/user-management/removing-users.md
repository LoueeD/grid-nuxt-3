# Removing Users

If there is a User that no longer requires access to a Project, they can be removed from the Project.

{% include tip.html content="You cannot remove [Account Admins](/building-a-project/adding-account-administrators) or the Account Owner from any Project within an Account." %}

To remove a User from a Project, start by selecting the **Users** tab in the top right corner of your Project.

![Permissions Tab](/assets/images/users-tab.jpg "Permissions Tab")

Open the options menu for the User that you would like to remove from the Project. Click **Remove User**.

Confirm the action by clicking **Remove**.

The User will lose access to the Gridfox Project.

{% include note.html content="Removing a User from a Project does not delete the User's Gridfox Account. They will be able to access other Projects they have been invited to." %}
