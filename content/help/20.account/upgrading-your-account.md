# Upgrading your Account

If you are on a free trial of Gridfox or your trial has expired, you can upgrade your Account to a paid subscription.

Within your subscription, you can choose the number of User Seats that you would like to add to your Account.

{% include note.html content="Every distinct User invited to a Project within your Account will required their own Seat." %}

Once you have started a subscription, you can add more Seats to your Account at any time.

## Types of User Seat

There are two types of User Seat in Gridfox:

1. **Read-Only Users**

   Your Account will have an automatic allocation of Read-Only seats.

   A User will occupy a Read-Only seat if all [Groups](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-permissions) they are in have marked as Read-Only.
2. **Seats**

   Gridfox licenses are priced per Seat.

## Subscribing to Gridfox

To create a Gridfox subscription, open up the Account Management section by selecting the Account Menu icon in the top right and then select **Settings**.

Enter your card details in the form and click **Confirm**.

Your Gridfox subscription will be created and the chosen number of Seats added to your Account.

If you selected to pay monthly for your subscription then payments will be taken each month on or around your first subscription sign up date.

If you selected to pay annually for your subscription then payments will be taken on the anniversary of your first subscription sign up date.

If payment for your subscription fails, payment will be retried for up to a week. In the case the retries are not successful, your subscription will be cancelled.

## Adding Seats to your Account

Once you have signed up for a Gridfox Subscription, you can add more User Seats to your Account at any time.

In the 'Manage Seats' section, click **Add Seats**.

Click **Confirm** to add the Seats to your Account.

If you are paying monthly for your subscription, your next and subsequent monthly payments will be for the new total number of Seats.

If you are paying annually for your subscription, you will pay a one-off prorated cost which is the cost per month of the additional seats multiplied by the number of months remaining on your annual subscription term. Your next and subsequent annual payments will be for the new total number of Seats.
