# Creating Records

To create a new Record, start by selecting one of the [Views](/gridfox-project/an-introduction-to-views) from the left hand navigation menu.

{% include tip.html content="You can create Records using any of the [Views](/gridfox-project/an-introduction-to-views) except for [Dashboard Views](/gridfox-project/dashboards)." %}

Each of the Views will allow you to create a new Record.

On a [Grid View](/gridfox-project/grid-views) or [Gantt View](/gridfox-project/gantt-screens) click the **Add Row** button.
