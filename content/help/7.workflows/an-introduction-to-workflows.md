# An Introduction to Workflows

Workflows allow you to define automated actions to be taken for your Gridfox records.

It may be useful, for example, to notify your Sales team when a new opportunity has been created. Or you may wish to send an email every week for everyone with their outstanding tasks.

A workflow is defined by four components:

1. Which [Table](/building-a-project/an-introduction-to-tables) the workflow is acting on
2. The action that triggers the workflow e.g. creation of a record, or a timed schedule
3. Any conditions which limit when the workflow is triggered
4. The action that is taken when the workflow has been triggered

Multiple workflows can be created for your Gridfox Tables.
